# mailspring-minimal-dark-theme
**Clean** and **bold** dark theme for mailspring. Inspired by [Isaac dark theme](https://github.com/jpminor/mailspring-isaac-dark-theme) and [Arc dark theme](https://github.com/mjohnson8165/mailspring-arc-dark).

Some differences with the Isaac dark theme:

* Dark theme rendering for email content.

* Tags are hidden in the email list view.
